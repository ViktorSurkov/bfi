        <p>Banks are considered as high risk Financial Institutions and affected by a global de-risking
          trend.
          Large banks are streamlining their existing correspondent banking network and as part of
          this
          process they exit certain type of banks, banks of a certain size, banks which fall below a
          certain
          transaction volume or banks from a specific geographic region.<br><br>

          Most smaller banks are affected by this in one or multiple ways. The typical bank we help
          has
          less
          than 1,000 employees and a correspondent banking department that is smaller than 10 people.
          With
          a
          limited team size it is especially difficult for these banks to work themselves through the
          banking
          directory and contact one bank after each other<br><br>

          Usually banks do not have an undefined planning horizon to find a new correspondent bank, so
          time is
          critical.<br><br>

          BFI has started to research the correspondent banking market from October 2015 on. With over
          2,700
          banks in our database we have a good understanding of the major clearing routes but also the
          niche
          players of correspondent banking. The niche players are often the ones who are willing to
          on-board
          the underbanked or unbanked smaller entities. With a focus on correspondent banking they are
          often
          even offering better services and understanding than major players.</p>
        <p>Has your correspondent bank given you notice or are you concerned that they will? Do you have
          more
          than one backup correspondent banking relationship to allow business continuity if the case
          comes
          through? Do you have a feeling about how long it would take you to find a new correspondent
          banking
          relationship? Give us a call or drop us a line. We’re happy to give you some insights.</p>

          <p>BFI introduces Financial Institutions to banks for the opening of correspondent banking and
            payment
            clearing and settlement accounts. We find a suitable bank but also manage the overall account
            application process. This has allowed BFI to build an in-depth knowledge of the KYC process and
            the
            information requirements of the correspondent bank. BFI provides client information that meet
            todays
            standards and makes sure</p>

            <li>the correspondent bank gets the required information in time, and in English</li>
            <li>there won’t be any concerns about the quality of the documentation received (content,
              completeness and accuracy)

            have the resources to review it? Do you want to outsource the on-boarding due diligence of new

        <p>Keeping up with ongoing customer due diligence, banks are required to verify customer data and
          information. Site visits are one way of doing this, however for a bank to visit a Financial
          Institution on another continent is financially not viable and worth it.<br><br>

          BFI is able to visit Financial Institutions in Europe, Asia and Australia in the following
          countries:</p>
